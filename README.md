# Welcome Vibe Coders!

👋🏼 Hey there **awesome colleague**.

Here you can get your hands on a set of **Vibe Code Exercises** to complement the Vibe Code Talk. Hope you like them. No need to pick them in chronological order, you can start with any app / idea that speaks most to you.

#### The exercises

## Your profile or technical skill doesn't really matter 😉

It does not really matter if you are a Technical Guru, a Storytelling Journalist, a Driven Architect, a Modern Pixel Designer or Nerdy Data Scientist.

Vibe coding ✨ is for everyone! 🚀

The goal is certainly **not to finish them all**. It is to have fun vibe coding and experiencing how well or how bad some models can help you in your journey. Use the tools you have learned about, or if you have already experimented before use tools you are accustomed to.

## Pairing is caring 🤝🏼

If you want you can always team up. It's more fun working in pair mode, developers do it all the time. This way you can get to know each other a little bit better and you can help each other during the code session.

## Some Ground Rules 👇🏼

- Use whatever models or service you like, **but don't share sensitive data
  (duh!)**
- Again, **it's not really a contest** and the exercises are not set in chronological order, however the 'bonus ones' are considered to be bigger exercises.
- When something is not working for you, or you are stuck, please ask for help!
- When you are on a roll and are creating something cool, you can **share it with the group later on**.
- Some exercises can have of course multiple outcomes, they are meant to inspire and to get you started, if you can come up with other features or other extra's, please do!

_If there is something you would like to ask, or you have some difficulty setting things up. I'll be happy to help you..._

Have fun! And!
Happy Vibe Coding!
