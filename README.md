# 🎉 Welcome, Vibe Coders!

👋🏼 Hey there, curious colleague.

You've landed in the right place to get your hands dirty with some ✨ Vibe Code Exercises ✨ — fun little creative experiments to explore during (or further after) this Vibe Code Lunch. No need to follow any strict order — just pick the one that sparks your interest first and start vibin'.

## 👇🏼 The Exercises

- [🍽️ Order Up! – The Interactive Menu Card](./1-menu-card/README.md)
- [🌌 Our Solar System – A Vibe-Coding Voyage](./2-solar-system/README.md)
- [☁️ Weather, or Not – Your Personal Forecast Vibe](./3-weather-widget/README.md)
- [🎮 Bonus! – Build Your Own Game](./bonus-build-a-game/README.md)
- [🏋️‍♀️ Bonus! – Vibe-Fit Coach™](./bonus-fitness-tracker/README.md)

Each one is a mini creative playground. Some are chill. Some are bold.A few are downright weird. All of them are built to inspire.

## 🧠 Your background doesn't really matter 😉 — your curiosity is the key

Whether you're a seasoned developer, a storytelling journalist, a modern pixel-slinger, a data wizard, or someone who just likes pressing buttons until cool things happen — you're welcome here.

Vibe coding is for everyone! 🎉

_The goal isn’t to finish all the exercises.
It’s to explore, play, and get a feel for what today’s tech (and your own instincts) can create together. Try out the tools we talked about. Or bring your own favorite toys. This is your sandbox._

## 🤝 Pairing is Caring

Feel like teaming up? Do it! 🤗

Pairing can make things more fun and collaborative. Devs do it all the time — and it's a great way to get to know each other while making cool stuff. One vibes, the other codes. Then switch. Or both vibe. No rules here.

## 🧷 A Few Loose Ground Rules

- 🧠 Use whatever tools, models, or services you want — just don’t paste in sensitive data (seriously… we’re not trying to train Skynet here).
- 🧭 These aren’t tests or puzzles. There’s no score. Start wherever. The “bonus” ones are just spicier or a bit more involved.
- 🆘 Stuck? Lost? Keyboard on fire? Ask for help — there’s no shame in debugging together.
- 📣 Got something cool in progress? Share it with the group! We love shiny things.
- 🎨 Each exercise is more of a launchpad than a recipe. If you want to go off-script and make it your own — please do!

_Got a question? Hit me up — I’m happy to help you get started, unstuck, or even just cheer you on. Now go on — crack your knuckles, queue the lo-fi beats, and enjoy the ride. 🎶🚀_

👉 Happy Vibe Coding! ✨
