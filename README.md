# 🎉 Welcome, Vibe Coders!

👋🏼 Hey there, curious colleague.

You've landed in the right place to get your hands dirty with some ✨ Vibe Code Exercises ✨ — fun little creative experiments to explore during (or further after) this Vibe Code Lunch. No need to follow any strict order — just pick the one that sparks your interest first and start vibin'.

## 👇🏼 The Exercises

- [🍽️ Order Up! – The Interactive Menu Card](./1-menu-card/README.md)
- [🌌 Our Solar System – A Vibe-Coding Voyage](./2-solar-system/README.md)
- [☁️ Weather, or Not – Your Personal Forecast Vibe](./3-weather-widget/README.md)
- [🎮 Bonus! – Build Your Own Game](./bonus-build-a-game/README.md)
- [🏋️‍♀️ Bonus! – Vibe-Fit Coach™](./bonus-fitness-tracker/README.md)

Each one is a mini creative playground. Some are chill. Some are bold. A few are downright weird. All of them are built to inspire.

## 📚 Not Ready to Code Yet?

No stress. If you’d rather ease into the vibe before diving in hands-first, check out some of the [📖 Resources](./RESOURCES.md) from the talk.

You’ll find extra context, tools, demos, and inspiration to help warm up your brain and spark some ideas. Whether you’re looking for technical guides or just want to get in the mood — start there.

Then come back when you're vibin'. 🎛️🌀

## 🤝 Pairing is Caring

Feel like teaming up? Do it! 🤗

Pairing can make things more fun and collaborative. Devs do it all the time — and it's a great way to get to know each other while making cool stuff. One vibes, the other codes. Then switch. Or both vibe. No rules here.

## 🧠 As we know, your background doesn't really matter 😉 — Your curiosity is the key

Whether you're a seasoned developer, a storytelling journalist, a modern pixel-slinger, a data wizard, or someone who just likes pressing buttons until cool things happen — you're welcome here.

Vibe coding is for everyone! 🎉

_The goal isn’t to finish all the exercises.
It’s to explore, play, and get a feel for what today’s tech (and your own instincts) can create together. Try out the tools we talked about. Or bring your own favorite toys. This is your sandbox._

## ⚠️ A Few Ground Rules

- 🧠 Use whatever tools, models, or services you want — just don’t paste in sensitive data (seriously… we’re not trying to train Skynet here).
- 🧭 These aren’t tests or puzzles. There’s no score. Start wherever. The “bonus” ones are just spicier or a bit more involved.
- 🆘 Stuck? Lost? Keyboard on fire? Ask for help — there’s no shame in debugging together.
- 📣 Got something cool in progress? Share it with the group! We love shiny things.
- 🎨 Each exercise is more of a launchpad than a recipe. If you want to go off-script and make it your own — please do!

_Got a question? Hit me up — I’m happy to help you get started, unstuck, or even just cheer you on. Now go on — crack your knuckles, queue the lo-fi beats, and enjoy the ride. 🎶🚀_

👉 Happy Vibe Coding! ✨
