# ☁️ Weather, or Not – Your Personal Forecast Vibe

Well, that Belgian weather sure is something, huh? One minute it’s sunny, the next it’s sideways rain. Sounds like the perfect excuse to vibe-code your own personal weather app — one that looks the way you want it to, feels good to use, and maybe even reacts to what’s happening in the skies above your head.

## ⛅️ Your app should let you:

- Select a location — via search, dropdown, or a draggable pin on a map.
- Display the current weather in style.
- Show a 5-day forecast that looks smooth and scrollable.
- Adapt its vibe to match the mood of the skies — bright, stormy, or mysteriously foggy.

📦 Don’t worry about being 100% accurate. You’re not building the next meteorological institute — just your own personalized, animated, good-feelin’ weather portal.

## ✨ Cool Enhancements to Try:

- 🌨️ Use animated SVGs, CSS, or canvas for backgrounds: clouds drift, rain falls, snow gently piles up, sun rays glow.
- 📱 Make the forecast swipeable like weather cards in a mobile app — think "one-day-per-card" with a little bounce.
- 🗘️ Let the user drag a pin or tap on a canvas map to pick a location and get that location’s weather — could even zoom in with scroll.
- 🎶 Add an audio layer: a "weather mood soundtrack" that changes based on conditions. Fog? Lo-fi chill. Thunderstorm? Synth bass drop.
- 💡 Add smooth transitions when the weather changes — slide in icons, fade in temperature updates, animate color palettes.
- 🌈 Surprise & delight: show a rainbow when sun and rain overlap.
- 🧠 Use weather-based quotes: “Looks like rain — maybe stay inside and code today?”
- 🌍 Add a "weather around the world" mode that shows multiple cities and animates their weather in real time (great for dashboards).

## 🌟 Bonus Challenge:

_Create a dark/light theme toggle that changes based on the time of day of the selected city — so your app literally reflects the sun’s cycle._

## 🌀 Forecast: 100% Chance of Creativity

Whether your weather app is minimal and moody or bursting with animations and ambient music, just let it reflect your vibe. Forget realism — follow the feels. Find examples, google, prompt or just create from scratch.

_☔ Make it shine, coder. Or rain. Or snow.
Or hail gently from the clouds with sparkles._

Your call. ☀️🎶
