# 🌌 Our Solar System – A Vibe-Coding Voyage

Time to blast off! 🚀🚀🚀

In this exercise, you’ll vibe-code a living, breathing solar system — a dynamic visual that feels alive in your browser.

_You’ll animate orbiting planets, create smooth transitions from one celestial body to the next, and maybe even sprinkle in some spacey sounds. Whether you go full 3D or keep it flat and minimal, the solar system is your playground._

## 🛠️ Your mission:

Draw the Sun and its planetary companions in orbit — animated and looping in real time.
Create an intuitive way to “travel” from planet to planet — think scroll zoom, keyboard shortcuts, or click-to-focus.
When a planet is selected, show off its cosmic ID card: name, distance from the Sun, orbital period, a fun fact, or even a weird moon it might have.

_💡 You don’t have to keep it super accurate — stylize, exaggerate, and let it groove. But if you want to ground it in reality..._

## 💪🏼 Power Boost Ideas:

- 🌍 Plug into real data — use NASA’s Horizons API or the astronomia package to pull live orbital elements.

- 🔍 Add scroll-to-zoom, mouse or arrow-key navigation — like flying a tiny ship through the planetary system.

- 🪐 When a planet is selected, show an info overlay or floating UI with speed, size, fun facts, etc.

- 🔊 Integrate audio: make each planet emit a soft tone when it orbits, aligns, or gets clicked.

- 🎨 Stylize the vibe: glowing trails, animated starfields, or even retro 8-bit sprites for each planet.

- 🌕 Add moons that orbit their parent planets and follow their own mini-paths.

- 🛰️ Show a comet or satellite passing through the system randomly or on a timer.

- 🎮 Build a “Planet Hopper” mode where you can jump from planet to planet using arrow keys and gravity physics.

- 🧲 Simulate basic physics: attraction to the Sun, velocity changes when zooming in/out.

_🎯 Bonus challenge: Make it touchscreen-friendly so your solar system runs on tablets or phones._

## 🧭 Now it's your turn to guide the stars.

- Start small: a sun, a circle, a planet.
- Then zoom out, scale up, and make the cosmos sing. Whether your universe is accurate or abstract, glowing or glitchy — make it yours.

_Have a good journey, explorer. The galaxy’s waiting.👽👽👽_
