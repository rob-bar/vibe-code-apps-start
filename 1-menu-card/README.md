# 🍽️ Order Up! – The Interactive Menu Card

It’s dinner time, and your screen is the table.
In this challenge, you’ll vibe-code a digital menu card that feels so smooth, it might make your audience hungry.

Think touchscreen-friendly food browsing, animated page transitions, and real-time order sending — just like a smart restaurant of the future. Whether you’re swiping through ramen or tapping tiramisu, this is where UI and UX meet up for a delicious date.

You can find some starter images in the provided folder. Heads up: they were scooped from Google and yeah... they're kinda crappy. But that’s the point — let’s see what you can make out of them. We’ve included dishes from a few local gems like [De Zeester](https://dezeester.be/), not far from our Antwerp office, and [Fiskeskur](https://fiskeskur.be/#av-masonry-1-item-150), up north in the harbor area. Want to use your own favorite (italian) restaurant instead? Go for it. You can even browse their website directly and pull fresher data if you’d rather not rely on our humble folder dump.

## 🛠️ Your mission:

- Build an interactive menu interface with the images provided, or with your own. Or with restaurant website data.
- Let users swipe or scroll between categories like “starters,” “mains,” “desserts.”
- Enable a way to “place an order” — maybe via a button that triggers a backend event, or by scanning a QR code that ties to your table.
- One small order hint: WebSockets are your sous chef 🍳.

## ✨ Spicy Enhancements:

- 🧾 Smooth page transitions (fade, slide, flip).
- 📱 Generate a table-specific QR code — scan it from your phone to “link” the order to that table.
- 🗣️ Voice ordering? Let users dictate their order with the Web Speech API — "One burger, no onions, please!"
- 🍔 Ingredient modifiers: Add buttons for "extra cheese" or "gluten-free bun" and update the live cart.
- 🛒 Animated order cart that slides in and updates in real-time.
- 🎉 Add subtle micro-interactions: plate wiggles when added, toast pop-up when confirmed, confetti when sent.
- 🔥 Add “chef view” on a separate screen that receives the live order (via socket) and prints it on a fake kitchen ticket.
- 🧂 Add a “What’s in it?” button — show ingredients and generate a preview image of the dish so users know what it’ll look like before ordering
- 💬 Add order status messages like “Burger: grilling 🔥” or “Fries: on the way 🚚”
- 📸 Bonus: Add dish animations or hover-over videos showing sizzling food.
- 🔐 For fun: simulate an “order confirmation” PIN screen or tap-to-pay UI.

_🎯 Stretch goal: let multiple users connect and place separate orders from the same table — with their names showing up on the kitchen screen._

## 🧑‍🍳 Now serve it hot.

Your canvas is the menu. Your code is the kitchen. The rest is pure presentation 🎨.

Whether your menu looks sleek and elegant, playful and chaotic, or downright glitchy — make it an experience people would tip for.

Bon appétit, chef. 👨‍🍳✨
